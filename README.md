"# Chatapp" 


Trying to make a cringy open source chat app to mess about with, feel free to send a PR

sorry if it's a mess, I'm figuring things out as I go.

everything is reasonably straight forward, fill in the values in `example.env` and rename it to `.env`
then enter `npm i` and `npm start`

few features I'd like to add (PR also welcome)
 - Rooms (maybe with DM)
 - Avatars
 - pings?
 - permissions
 - changing modifier (if you have permissions	)
 - changing colour of username (optionally with permissions)
 - possible login without github
